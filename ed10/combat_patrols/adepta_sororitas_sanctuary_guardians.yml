    effect: >-
      Each unit from your army can perform one Act of Faith per phase. This is done using Miracle
      dice. You gain 1 Miracle dice at the start of each turn and each time an ADEPTA SORORITAS unit
      from your army is destroyed. Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army with
      the Acts of Faith ability, if you have one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit
      can perform an Act of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool to
      substitute that dice roll. You can use Miracle dice for Advance rolls, Battle-shock tests,
      Charge rolls, Damage rolls, Hit rolls, Saving throws, and Wound rolls.

      Each time you use this Stratagem, you can discard 1 Miracle dice. Until the end of the phase,
      each time a model in your unit is destroyed, if that model has not shot or fought this phase,
      roll one D6, adding 1 to the result if you discarded a Miracle dice when using this Stratagem.
      On a 4+, do not remove the destroyed model from play; it can shoot or fight after the
      attacking unit has finished making its attacks, and is then removed from play.
