      miraculous deeds of fortitude and divine strength.

      Gaining Miracle Dice

      Each unit from your army can perform one Act of Faith per phase. This is
      done using Miracle dice.

      You gain 1 Miracle dice:
      * At the start of each turn.
      * Each time an Adepta Sororitas unit from your army is destroyed.

      Each time you gain a Miracle dice, roll one D6. The number you roll is the
      value of that Miracle dice. This value cannot be changed or re-rolled,
      unless a rule specifically states otherwise.
    effect: >-
      Performing an Act of Faith

      Before making a dice roll for a model or unit from your army, if you have
      one or more dice in your Miracle dice pool, that unit can perform an Act
      of Faith. If it does, select one of the dice from your Miracle dice pool
      to substitute that dice roll (if a roll involves more than one dice, e.g.
      a Charge roll or Battle-shock test, only a single dice can be
      substituted). The dice that is being substituted is not rolled; instead
      the value of the selected Miracle dice is used as if it had been rolled
      (this counts as an unmodified dice roll of that value for all rules
      purposes).
    phases:
      - command
      - movement
      - shooting
      - charge
      - fight
    restrictions: >-
      Each Miracle dice can only be selected for substitution once.

      You can use Miracle dice when a unit performs an Act of Faith for any of
      the following types of dice roll:

      * Advance roll
      * Battle-shock test
      * Charge roll
      * Damage roll
      * Hit roll
      * Saving throw
      * Wound roll
