      Created deep in the Emperor's Palace using esoteric gene-alchemies and other,
      even more mysterious processes, the warriors of the Adeptus Custodes are the
      Emperor's personal bodyguards. Known as the Ten Thousand, they are the most
      elite warriors in the entire Imperium, and are armed and armoured to match. In
      battle, they deploy highly flexible fighting forces, from peerless infantry and
      lightning-fast jetbikes to indomitable combat walkers and line-shattering battle
      tanks. It is in melee combat that they truly excel, however, each warrior having
      mastered the nuanced and subtle fighting stances designed to dominate the
      Custodians' many enemies.
    usage: >-
      At the start of the Fight phase, select one Ka'tah
      Stance from the list below to be active for your army until the end of the
      phase. While a Ka'tah Stance is active for your army, each unit from your army
      with this ability gains the relevant ability.

      ability.

      RENDAX STANCE
