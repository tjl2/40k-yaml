      In your Command phase, OFFICER models from your army with this ability can issue Orders.
      Each OFFICER's datasheet will specify how many Orders it can issue and which units are
      eligible to receive those Orders. Each time an OFFICER model issues an Order, select one
      of the Orders below, then select one eligible friendly unit within 6" of that OFFICER model
      to issue it to.

      Until the start of your next Command phase, the unit you selected is affected by that Order.
      Unless otherwise stated, a unit can only be affected by one Order at a time (any Order
      subsequently issued to that unit replaces the current one). If a unit being affected by an
      Order becomes Battle-shocked, that Order ceases to affect that unit.

      ### Move! Move! Move!

      Add 3" to the Move characteristic of models in this unit.

      ### Take Aim!

      Improve the Ballistic Skill characteristic of ranged weapons equipped by
      models in this unit by 1.

      ### Take Cover!

      Improve the Save characteristic of models in this unit by 1 (this cannot
      improve a model's Save
      to better than 3+).
