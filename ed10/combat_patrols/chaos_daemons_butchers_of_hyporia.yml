    effect: >-
      Certain areas of the battlefield are considered to be within your army's Shadow of Chaos, as follows:

      * Your deployment zone is always within your army's Shadow of Chaos.

      * At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within No Man's
        Land, until the end of that phase, No Man's Land is within your army's Shadow of Chaos.

      * At the start of any phase, if you control at least half of the objective markers within your
        opponent's deployment zone, until the end of that phase, your opponent's deployment zone is
        within your army's Shadow of Chaos.

      ### Daemonic Manifestation

      While a unit from your army is within your army's Shadow of Chaos, each
      time that unit takes a Battle-shock test, add 1 to that test and, if that test is passed, one
      model in that unit regains up to D3 lost wounds (if that unit is a BATTLELINE unit and that test
      is passed, up to D3 destroyed models can be returned to that unit instead).

      ### Daemonic Terror

      While an enemy unit is within your army's Shadow of Chaos, each time that unit
      takes a Battle-shock test, subtract 1 from that test and, if that test is failed, that enemy unit
      suffers D3 mortal wounds.
