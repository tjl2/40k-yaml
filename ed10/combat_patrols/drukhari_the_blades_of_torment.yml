abilities:
  - name: Power from Pain
    effect: >-
      Units from your army can become Empowered Through Pain. This is done using Pain tokens. You gain 1 Pain token:
      * At the start of the battle.
      * Each time an enemy unit is destroyed.
      * Each time an enemy unit fails a Battle-shock test.

      Each time you gain a Pain token, keep it to one side â€“ this is your Pain token pool.
      At the start of any phase, you can expend one or more Pain tokens from your Pain token pool. Each time you do, select one unit from your army with the Power from Pain ability. Until the end of the phase, that unit is Empowered, and gains the abilities listed below, depending on the phase.

      Empowered in the Movement or Charge phase: You can re-roll Advance or Charge rolls made for that unit.

      Empowered in the Shooting or Fight phase: Each time a model in that unit makes an attack, you can re-roll the Hit roll.
