      Each time a unit with this ability is destroyed, roll one D6, adding 3 to the result if it is a
      BATTLELINE unit. On a 4+, that unit is placed into Cult Ambush and you can place one Cult Ambush
      marker anywhere on the battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy units
      (if this is not possible, no marker is placed).

      If an enemy model (excluding AIRCRAFT models) ends any kind of move within 9" of a Cult Ambush
      marker you placed, that Cult Ambush marker is removed from the battlefield. At the end of the
      Reinforcements step of your opponent's next Movement phase, for each of your Cult Ambush markers
      that is still on the battlefield, you can select one unit from your army that is in Cult Ambush
      and set that destroyed unit back up on the battlefield using the Deep Strike ability, containing
      all of its models with their full wounds remaining and with at least one of those models touching
      that Cult Ambush marker (that Cult Ambush marker is then removed from the battlefield).

      CHARACTERS that are attached to a unit with this ability are not returned alongside that unit
      should it return to the battlefield as described above (only the Bodyguard unit returns).

      Combat Patrol: When playing a Combat Patrol battle, in battle rounds four and five, you cannot
      set up any units that are in Cult Ambush on the battlefield.
