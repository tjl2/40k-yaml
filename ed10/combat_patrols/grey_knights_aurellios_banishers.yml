      At the end of your opponent's turn, you can select one GREY KNIGHTS unit from your army with
      this ability (excluding units that are within Engagement Range of one or more enemy units).
      Remove that unit from the battlefield.

      In the Reinforcements step of your next Movement phase, set that unit up anywhere on the
      battlefield that is more than 9" horizontally away from all enemy models. Any units that are
      not on the battlefield at the end of the battle count as destroyed.
