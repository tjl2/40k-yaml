      Each time an enemy unit destroys a LEAGUES OF VOTANN unit from your army, that enemy unit
      gains 1 Judgement token. An enemy unit can never have more than 2 Judgement tokens (any
      further Judgement tokens a unit would gain beyond this are ignored).

      Each time a model from your army makes an attack that targets a unit that has one or more
      Judgement tokens, until that model's attacks have been resolved, apply the relevant bonus
      from the table below to that attack.

      1 Judgement Token - Eminent Threat: Add 1 to the Hit roll.
      2 Judgement Tokens - Now We've Got a Grudge to Settle: Add 1 to the Hit roll and add 1 to
      the Wound roll.
