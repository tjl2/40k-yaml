  - name: Reanimation Protocols
    effect: >-
      At the end of your Command phase, each unit from your army activates its Reanimation
      Protocols and reanimates D3 wounds. Each time such a unit reanimates a wound:

      * If that unit contains one or more models with fewer than their starting number of wounds
        remaining, select one of those models; that model regains one lost wound.
      * If all models in that unit have their starting number of wounds, but that unit is not at
        its Starting Strength, one destroyed model is returned to that unit with one wound remaining.

      Once such a unit is at its Starting Strength and all of its models have their starting
      number of wounds, nothing further happens.
