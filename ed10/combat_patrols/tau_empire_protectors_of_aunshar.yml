      In your Shooting phase, units from your army can work in pairs to help each other target
      specific enemy units. When they do this, one unit is the Observer unit and the other is their
      Guided unit. The enemy they are targeting is called their Spotted unit. Each time you select
      this unit to shoot, if it is not an Observer unit, it can use this ability. If it does,
      select one other friendly unit with this ability (note that AUN'SHAR does not have this
      ability) that is also eligible to shoot (excluding Battle-shocked and Observer units). Until
      the end of the phase, this unit is considered a Guided unit, and that friendly unit is
      considered an Observer unit. Then select one enemy unit that is visible to both your units to
      be their Spotted unit. Until the end of the phase:
      * Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an attack that targets their Spotted unit, improve
        the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack by 1 and, if their Observer unit has the
        MARKERLIGHT keyword, the attack has the [IGNORES COVER] ability.
      * Each time a model in a Guided unit makes an attack that does not target their Spotted unit,
        worsen the Ballistic Skill characteristic of the attack by 1.

      Your unit can shoot that enemy unit as if it were your Shooting phase. When doing so, each
      time a model in your unit makes a ranged attack, an unmodified Hit roll of 6 is required to
      score a hit, irrespective of the attacking weapon's Ballistic Skill or any modifiers. Until
      the end of the phase, subtract 2 from Charge rolls made for that enemy unit.
    restrictions: Your unit cannot shoot more than once this turn.
