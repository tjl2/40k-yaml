      At the end of your Command phase, each model from your army with this ability that is on the
      battlefield (excluding Battle-shocked models) generates you a number of Cabal points equal
      to the number shown in its ability. The combined total of these is your Cabal points pool.

      During the battle round, you can use Rituals from the list below, deducting the Cabal points
      cost of each one from your Cabal points pool. If you do not have enough Cabal points for a
      Ritual, you cannot use it. Each Ritual can only be used once per phase. At the start of your
      next Command phase, your Cabal points pool resets to zero. Each time you use a Ritual, select
      one THOUSAND SONS PSYKER model from your army, then apply that Ritual's effect using that PSYKER.

      Weaver of Fates (Psychic)
      2 Cabal points. Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once during that phase, when a
      saving throw is failed for a friendly THOUSAND SONS model whose unit is within 18" of this
      PSYKER, you can re-roll that saving throw.

      Echoes from the Warp (Psychic)
      6 Cabal points. Use this Ritual at the start of any phase. Once this phase, you can select
      this PSYKER's unit as the target of a Stratagem for 0CP, even if you have already used that
      Stratagem this phase.
