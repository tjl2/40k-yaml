abilities:
  - name: Synapse
    description: >-
      Some Tyranids serve as synaptic conduits or nodal relays through which a
      portion of the Hive Mind's iron will flows, overriding the natural
      instincts of the swarm to direct the teeming warrior-beasts to function as
      a single, gestalt organism on the battlefield.
    usage: >-
      While a Tyranids unit from your army is within 6" of one or more friendly
      Synapse models, that Tyranids unit is said to be within Synapse Range of
      those models and of your army.
    effect: >-
      Each time a Tyranids unit from your army takes a Battle-shock test, if it
      is within Synapse Range of your army, take that test on 3D6 instead of
      2D6.

    description: >-
      Tyranids flood the battlefield with the psychic signature of the hive
      fleet, an icy, alien dread that gnaws at the minds of their prey and
      smothers even the most stalwart courage. When faced with such unfathomable
      horror, many are driven insane or suffer catastrophic neural damage.
    usage: >-
      Once per battle, in either player's Command phase, if one or more units
      from your army with this ability are on the battlefield, you can unleash
      the Shadow in the Warp.
    effect: >-
      Each enemy unit on the battlefield must take a Battle-shock test.

      Otherwise, add a new unit to your army identical to your destroyed unit,
      in Strategic Reserves, containing 2D6 models.
