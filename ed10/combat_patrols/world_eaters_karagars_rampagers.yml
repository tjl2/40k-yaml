    description: >-
      Khorne is the god of warfare and slaughter, and provides for those who
      consecrate the battlefield in his name.
    usage: >-
      At the start of the battle round, you can make a Blessings of Khorne roll.
      To do so, roll eight D6. You can then use those dice to activate up to two
      Blessings of Khorne from the Blessings of Khorne list (see below). Each
      Blessing of Khorne specifies the dice results it requires (where a number
      is specified, a double or triple of that value or higher is required). You
      can only activate each Blessing of Khorne once per battle round. Any
      unused dice from the Blessings of Khorne roll are then discarded.

      Once activated, each Blessing of Khorne applies to all units from your
      army until the end of the battle round.

      ### WRATHFUL DEVOTION
      **Any double.** Models in this unit have the Feel No Pain 6+ ability. If
      models in this unit already have the Feel No Pain ability, add 1 to their
      Feel No Pain rolls.

      ### TOTAL CARNAGE
      **Double 4+ or any triple.** Each time a model in this unit is destroyed by a
      melee attack, if that model has not fought this phase, roll one D6: on a
      4+, do not remove it from play. The destroyed model can fight after the
      attacking model's unit has finished making its attacks, and is then
      removed from play.

      ### WARP BLADES
      **Double 5+ or any triple.** Melee weapons equipped by models in this unit
