    If a model is in Hover mode, then until the end of the battle, its Move
    characteristic is changed to 20", it loses the **Aircraft** keyword and it
    loses all associated rules for being an **Aircraft** model. Models in Hover

    into Strategic Reserves following the normal rules if you wish.
